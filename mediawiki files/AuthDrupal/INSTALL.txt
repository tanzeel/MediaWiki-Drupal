<!-- distributed with AuthDrupal v 0.7, 2010-0303 -->

If you are reading this in an INSTALL.txt file, then these instructions are for
the version of the files you have.

The latest version of these instructions and of the code can be found at
[http://www.mediawiki.org/w/index.php?title=Extension:AuthDrupal].

* download the AuthDrupal files and save or unpack them into
  wiki/extensions/AuthDrupal/

* put mediawikiauth.module, mediawikiauth.info, and a copy of AuthDrupalEncode.php into
  drupal/sites/all/modules/mediawikiauth (yes, you want AuthDrupalEncode.php in both places).

* Add code in AddToLocalSettings.php to the end of your wiki/LocalSettings.php
  file. Change the database settings to match your setup.
  
  Change the cookie domain name  to the domain under which your Drupal and wiki
  are hosted.  If you're running this on localhost, leave the cookiedomain blank.
  ($wgCookieDomain = '')

  If drupal and mediawiki use the same database, just set
  $wgAuthDrupal_UseExtDatabase = false and ignore most of the  _MySQL_ settings.

* You need to assign a key to use to encode the username to prevent spoofing.
  Make up a key string (something unique, think of it as a password) and set
  the same value for wgAuthDrupal_security_key in both LocalSettings.php
  and mediawikiauth.module.
  
* Edit the other settings at the top of mediawikiauth.module so that each item matches
  what you have set in LocalSettings.php. If you have multiple wikis sharing
  the same Drupal login, create a block of settings for each wiki. If you only
  have one wiki, delete the second example settings.

* To get rid of the "You must log in to edit pages" notice when a non-logged-in
  user clicks the Edit tab, do the following:

  ** Go to the article called "MediaWiki:Whitelistedittext".
  ** The edit box should be preloaded with this text: "You have to $1 to edit
     pages."
  ** Change this to the following (replace the url with whatever you've set for
     $wgAuthDrupal_LoginURL):

     You have to <span class="plainlinks">[http://mydomain.com log in]</span> to edit pages.

* go into Drupal admin pages and enable the Mediawiki module

Things should work at this point. If behavior is funny at first, delete the
cookies for your domain, and try it again with a fresh start.

Optional parts:

* you may want to ensure that account creation is blocked. Try going to
  /wiki/index.php?title=Special:Userlogin&type=signup
  (TODO: document how to turn off account creation)

* even though the extension can change the login/logout link to point to Drupal,
  that does not stop a savvy user from going to Special:Userlogin directly. You
  may want to edit .htaccess to redirect that URL. There are instructions for
  this at the bottom of this page:
